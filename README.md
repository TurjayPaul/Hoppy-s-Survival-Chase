# Hoppy's Survival Chase

## Game Description

**Hoppy's Survival Chase** is a 2D survival game where the player controls a rabbit to collect food while avoiding enemies and traps. Carrots and grapes increase the score, apples restore lives, and special items like strawberries grant temporary invisibility. The game includes multiple levels, a scoring system with saved high scores, and dynamic challenges that increase with progression. Additional features include background music, sound effects, and interactive menus for starting, instructions, scores, and settings.

## Features
- The player controls a rabbit that moves using W/A/S/D or arrow keys across the game screen.

- The rabbit can collect carrots and grapes to increase the score, while apples restore lives.

- A score system tracks the rabbit’s progress, and each level has its own high score record.

- The rabbit must avoid traps, hawks, and squirrels, which reduce lives or cause a game over.

- Special items like strawberries grant temporary invisibility, and grapes allow short hopping boosts.

- The game features multiple levels; scoring 250 points in Level 1 unlocks Level 2.

- If lives reach zero, the game triggers a Game Over page with sounds, resetting the score to 0.

- The game has menus for Start, How to Play, Scores, About, and Settings, with background music toggle options.
